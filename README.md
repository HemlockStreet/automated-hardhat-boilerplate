# Robust Boilerplate for Hardhat Deployments

This is a boilerplate for quick contract development; meaning that getting started is as simple as using `yarn diag` to autogenerate a `.env` file. From here, your environment is immediately ready for use on `polygon`, `mumbai`, `goerli`, `ethereum`, `bsc`, `bscTestnet`, `opera`, `ftmTestnet`, `avax`, & `fuji`. To see the autogenerated config, simply run the `diag` script again!

## Features

Credentials:

- .env autogeneration triggered just by using `npx hardhat`
- if no wallets are found, it will randomly generate 5 wallets and store them in your .env file
- .env diagnostics with `require('./utils/evm/diagnostics.js')` or `yarn diag`

Settings:

- preconfigured gas reporter (NOTE: disabled until you provide your own API key)
- preconfigured networks with free rpc providers

Deployments:

- deployment scripts with built-in contract auto-verification. (NOTE: disabled until you provide your own API key)
- all deployed contract ABIs are stored in `./utils/interfaces`
- all deployed contract addresses are stored in `./utils/deploymentMap/${chainId}.json` organized by contract name.
